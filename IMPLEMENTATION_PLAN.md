## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Self-review and testing
4. Create pull request with documentation
5. Code review by team
6. Merge to main after approval

### Component Structure
- Each component should have its own directory
- Include index.ts for exports
- Separate logic from presentation
- Use React hooks for state management

### Firebase Best Practices

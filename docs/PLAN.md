# Plan for Implementing Quick Wins and Fixing Issues

## Objective
Address identified issues and implement quick wins to prepare the project for a professional launch. The focus is on improving security, performance, SEO, accessibility, and testing.

---

## Proposed Changes

### 1. **Security**
- **Define Firebase Storage Rules**:
  - Create a `storage.rules` file to restrict access to authenticated users and implement role-based permissions.
  - Example:
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Review Firestore Rules**:
  - Restrict open read access for `themes` and `reviews` collections.

---

### 2. **Performance**
- **Optimize Images**:
  - Convert images in `public/` to optimized formats like `webp` or `avif`.
  - Use Next.js `Image` component for all images.

- **Enable Lazy Loading**:
  - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components and images.

---

### 3. **SEO**
- **Enhance Metadata**:
  - Use `next-seo` to define metadata for all pages, including titles, descriptions, and Open Graph tags.

- **Generate Sitemap**:
  - Ensure `/sitemap.xml` dynamically generates a complete sitemap for better search engine indexing.

---

### 4. **Accessibility**
- **Audit Components**:
  - Perform an accessibility audit using tools like axe.
  - Fix issues related to keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.

---

### 5. **Testing**
- **Add Unit Tests**:
  - Write unit tests for critical components and Firebase integration logic.

- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - Implement end-to-end tests for key user flows like booking and authentication.

---

## Risks and Validation
- **No Database Schema Changes**:
  - Ensure no changes are made to the database schema.

- **Testing with Firebase Emulators**:
  - Use Firebase emulators for testing changes.

- **Validation Steps**:
  - Run the following commands to validate:
    - `npm run lint`
    - `npm run type-check`
    - Lighthouse (target: Perf ≥90, A11y ≥95, SEO ≥95)

---

## Execution Plan
1. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Name: `agent/sprint-1`.

2. **Implement Changes**:
   - Make the proposed changes in the branch.

3. **Commit Changes**:
   - Commit with the message: `fix: implement quick wins for security and perf`.

4. **Review and Merge**:
   - Submit a pull request for review and merge.

---

## Notes
- Chrome installation is required to run Lighthouse. Ensure Chrome is installed and accessible.
- Create a Lighthouse configuration file if needed.
